## Improving the Quality of Healthcare by Analyzing HCAHPS Survey Results in 2015-2023
I worked as a Data Analyst for the American Hospital Association (AHA). AHA is a national organization that represents hospitals and their patients. My role is to analyze Hospital Consumer Assessment
of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey results for the last 9 years (2015 – 2023).

American Hospital Association (AHA) provided datasets to analyse Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey results between 2015 and 2023. The purpose of this 
project is to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patients’ perspectives on hospital care, and one of its three main goals is to establish incentives for hospitals across the country
to improve the quality of care being rendered.

## Tasks

i) Have hospitals’ HCAHPS scores improved over the last 9 years?’

ii) Are they any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?

iii) Are there any major areas of opportunity remaining?

iv) What recommendations can you make to hospitals to help them further improve the patient experience?

## Key Insights

Since 2015, the Top-box responses (answers to the questions considered most positive) from patients in general has been increasing steadily since 2015 until 2020, however, the most positive feedbacks 
began to drop in 2021. Also, in the last 9 years, the rate at which patients responded to survey has decreased by 26%. There was remarkable drop between 2021 and 2023 and this may be due to Covid19
pandemic. In terms of Measure ID, only one Measure ID has its highest amount of most positive responses in 2022. All other Measure ID has their highest number of most positive responses earlier than 2022.

Hospitals in Wisconsin, Kansas and Pennsylvania all have the highest response rates across the country. Furthermore, it is observed that the response rate from the hospitals in the northern part of USA is
higher than that of their counterparts in the south. The same also applies to positive feedbacks where more Top-box responses are obtained from the north. Out of all the 10 Measure IDs, hospitals in SD 
scored have the highest positive feedbacks in 5 Measure IDs.

## Recommendations

Hospitals in Wisconsin, Kansas and Pennsylvania with highest response rates need to be studied in order to replicate the feat in other hospitals across the country. Discharge information, communication 
with doctors and nurses have all been receiving a lot of the most positive feedbacks. However, urgent attention is needed to make sure that excellent care transitions are being delivered to patients in
moving them to from one healthcare setting to another or to their homes. Care transition received the lowest Top-box responses from patients. Another aspect that requires speedy improvement is the 
quietness of the hospitals’ environments. From the study, it can be concluded that many patients have not been happy with noises coming within and outside many hospitals while receiving their treatments.
Responsiveness of hospital staffs and communications about medicines should be improved as well since they are also analysed to have one of the lowest Top-box responses.
